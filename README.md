# online-attendance
The project is meant to create an advanced attendance taking system to help teachers, students and college administration by automating the entire process. It is designed keeping scalability and code- reusability in mind, which means that the same project can be altered by changing few variables to get desired results. Furthermore, thereâ€™s scope of adding more functionality without disturbing any of the existing one. This is made possible by using Object Oriented Programming, a Modular for designing web service, and following large parts of MVC model. This allows us to extend the project to mobile applications and other environments.
